# RecomenderSystem
The API crafted with FastAPI is designed to recommend movies based on user preferences and ratings. It utilizes a RESTful architecture to serve movie recommendations and similar movie suggestions, leveraging a collaborative filtering approach

## Description

The RecommenderSystem project is a movie recommendation system built with FastAPI. It uses collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies to users based on the preferences of other similar users. The main functionality of the system is to receive a list of movie identifiers and generate recommendations for them. 
The system is developed using FastAPI, a backend framework for Python that makes it easy to create and test endpoints, as it abstracts away many complicated aspects of the REST API. In addition, it uses MongoDB to store movie data and ratings.
